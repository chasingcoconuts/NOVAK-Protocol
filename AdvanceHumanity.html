Will this advance humanity?

Yes, but not because of "Crypto" or "Money."

It advances humanity because it solves the "Trust Me, Bro" problem.

Right now, when an AI, a bank, or a government says, "We processed your application fairly," you have to blindly trust them. This technology removes blind trust and replaces it with Mathematical Proof.

For AI: Right now, AI is a "Black Box." We don't know why it makes decisions. If we force AI to run inside this "NOVAK Loop," we create an unchangeable audit trail of every "thought" the AI had. If an AI denies your loan or misdiagnoses a patient, we can look at the Hash Chain and see exactly what data it used and what rule it followed.

For Truth: In an age of Deepfakes, this "Chaining" allows cameras to sign video the instant it is recorded. If the video is edited later, the math fails. It proves what is real.

The Bottom Line: This technology forces honesty. It makes lying mathematically impossible for automated systems. That is a massive upgrade for civilization.
