## 🔹 WHAT IS NOVAK?

NOVAK is the first execution-integrity model requiring cryptographic proof that
an automated decision followed the governing rules *before* it is allowed to run.

It contains four enforcement primitives:

| Primitive  | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **NIPS**   | Verifies all inputs are attested and valid |
| **HARMONEE** | Produces immutable execution receipts |
| **REVELATION** | Creates a recursive global audit hash |
| **Equal Execution Law** | Prevents unequal outcomes under equal inputs |

This repository contains the **first working demonstration engine** capable of
producing NOVAK-valid execution proofs.

## 🔹 WHAT THIS DEMO SHOWS

✔ Deterministic decision execution  
✔ Hash-based proof objects  
✔ Chain-linked audit receipts  
✔ Equal execution consistency behavior

This is NOT a full federal-scale implementation.
This is a **reference demonstrator** for researchers, auditors, and engineers.

## 🔹 WHY THIS MATTERS

NOVAK introduces the world’s first enforceable rule:

> **“No system may execute without provable truth.”**

That makes it:

- Constitutionally enforceable
- AI-compatible
- Court admissible
- Cryptographically verifiable
