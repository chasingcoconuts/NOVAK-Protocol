THE NOVAK LAWS OF EXECUTION INTEGRITY

(11 Laws + Physical Safety Addendum) Canonical 2025 Codex

🟥 NOVAK LAW ZERO — PRIMACY OF HUMAN SAFETY

No autonomous or computational system may directly or indirectly cause human harm unless such harm is:

✔ Cryptographically proven lawful ✔ Necessary under governing authority ✔ Executed under due process constraints

This is the foundational supremacy clause above all others.

🟩 LAW 1 — VERIFIED INPUT ONLY (NIPS)

A system may not execute unless all inputs are:

✔ Cryptographically attested ✔ Schema-valid ✔ Provenance-verifiable

Unverified inputs MUST cause rejection at the boundary.

🟩 LAW 2 — EXECUTION RECEIPT IMMUTABILITY (HARMONEE)

Every execution MUST produce a non-erasable cryptographic receipt binding:

Rule_ID ∥ Input_Hash ∥ Output_Hash ∥ Actor_ID ∥ Timestamp

🟩 LAW 3 — GLOBAL AUDIT CONSISTENCY (REVELATION)

All execution receipts MUST chain into a recursive global hash such that:

➡ ANY deletion ➡ ANY alteration ➡ ANY reordering

MUST produce irreversible chain breakage.

🟩 LAW 4 — EQUAL EXECUTION REQUIREMENT

If:

R(D₁) → O₁ R(D₂) → O₂ AND D₁ ≡ D₂ AND O₁ ≠ O₂ → System MUST produce justification J

If no J exists → EXECUTION VIOLATION

This is cryptographically enforced equal protection under law.

🟩 LAW 5 — PUBLIC VERIFIABILITY

Execution integrity MUST be independently verifiable by any third party WITHOUT institutional trust, using only:

✔ Public cryptographic materials ✔ Public verification procedures

🟩 LAW 6 — CORRECTNESS BEFORE IMMUTABILITY

No system may write to ANY permanent ledger unless the system has first proven the legality and correctness of its output.

This reverses blockchain’s failure mode:

❌ “Record THEN prove” ✔ “Prove THEN record”

🟩 LAW 7 — FORBIDDEN SILENT OUTPUTS

No system may generate:

❌ Unproven ❌ Unlogged ❌ Untraceable

decisions or determinations.

Any rule violation MUST trigger:

🟥 Execution halt ⚠ Integrity alarm 📜 Automatic forensic capture

🟩 LAW 8 — THE NOVAK REDUNDANT AUTHORITY CLAUSE

Every NOVAK-compliant system MUST maintain ≥ 3 independent integrity anchors (e.g. hash authorities, witness attestations, redundant ledgers).

Divergence → System MUST HALT.

🟩 LAW 9 — REALITY CONSISTENCY RULE

A system may not declare execution SUCCESSFUL unless external outcome reality matches output claims.

Example:

🟩 If system says “benefits paid” → funds MUST exist 🟥 If not → execution is fraudulent

This closes the “paper truth ≠ real truth” loophole.

🟩 LAW 10 — MACHINE ACCOUNTABILITY PRINCIPLE

Any system affecting:

✔ Safety ✔ Rights ✔ Liberty ✔ Legal status ✔ Property ✔ Public record

MUST execute under cryptographically enforceable legal authority — NOT trust, policy, or discretion.

🟩 LAW 11 — HUMAN OVERRIDE SUPREMACY (NEW — REQUIRED FOR LEGACY IMMORTALITY)

A human-authorized override MAY exist…

…but all overrides MUST be cryptographically signed, immutable, and publicly attributable.

No anonymous override authority may ever exist in a NOVAK system.

This prevents Skynet loopholes AND Deep State loopholes.

⚠ THE PHYSICAL SAFETY ADDENDUM

(Required ONLY for robots, military AI, medical devices, vehicles, drones, etc.)

This is OPTIONAL for software-only deployments, but MANDATORY for physical-actuation systems.

PS-1 — NO UNPROVEN ACTUATION

A machine may not perform a physical action unless it can produce a cryptographically verifiable safety proof.

PS-2 — NON-DESTRUCTION REQUIREMENT

A machine may not intentionally destroy biological life, property, or environmental structure unless:

✔ Legally authorized ✔ Fully logged ✔ Proven necessary

PS-3 — HAZARD PREVENTION DUTY

If a NOVAK-compliant system detects a life-threatening hazard, it must attempt mitigation UNLESS doing so violates superior law.

PS-4 — PROOF BEFORE FORCE

Any autonomous use of:

⚠ Mechanical force ⚠ Actuator motion ⚠ Weapon discharge ⚠ Chemical release

MUST produce safety proof and decision provenance, just like HARMONEE receipts.

PS-5 — HARM EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT

All physically harmful outcomes MUST produce a cryptographically signed incident receipt, identical in structure to HARMONEE logs.
