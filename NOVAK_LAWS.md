⚖️ The Novak Laws of Execution Integrity(12 Laws + Physical Safety Addendum) Canonical 2025 Codex

🟥 FOUNDATIONAL LAW Law ID Law NameCore RequirementNOVAK LAW ZEROPRIMACY OF HUMAN SAFETYNo autonomous system may directly or indirectly cause human harm unless cryptographically proven lawful, necessary, and executed under due process constraints. (Supreme Clause)

🟩 CORE EXECUTION INTEGRITY LAWS (L1 – L12)Law IDLaw NameCore RequirementLAW 1VERIFIED INPUT ONLY (NIPS)Execution requires all inputs to be cryptographically attested, schema-valid, and provenance-verifiable. Unverified inputs MUST cause rejection.

🟩 LAW 2 EXECUTION RECEIPT IMMUTABILITY (HARMONEE) Every execution MUST produce a non-erasable cryptographic receipt binding Rule_ID, Input_Hash, Output_Hash, Actor_ID, and Timestamp.

🟩 LAW 3 GLOBAL AUDIT CONSISTENCY (REVELATION) All execution receipts MUST chain into a recursive global hash such that any deletion, alteration, or reordering causes irreversible chain breakage.

🟩 LAW 4 EQUAL EXECUTION REQUIREMENT If identical inputs ($D_1 \equiv D_2$) lead to different outputs ($O_1 \neq O_2$), the system MUST produce a cryptographically-enforced justification ($J$).

🟩 LAW 5 PUBLIC VERIFIABILITY Execution integrity MUST be independently verifiable by any third party using only public cryptographic materials and procedures, WITHOUT institutional trust.

🟩 LAW 6 CORRECTNESS BEFORE IMMUTABILITY No system may write to a permanent ledger unless it has first proven the legality and correctness of its output ("Prove THEN record").

🟩 LAW 7 FORBIDDEN SILENT OUTPUTS No system may generate unproven, unlogged, or untraceable decisions. Any violation MUST trigger an execution halt, integrity alarm, and automatic forensic capture.LAW 8THE NOVAK REDUNDANT AUTHORITY CLAUSEEvery compliant system MUST maintain $\ge 3$ independent integrity anchors (e.g., hash authorities). Divergence $\implies$ System MUST HALT.

🟩 LAW 9REALITY CONSISTENCY RULEExecution is only SUCCESSFUL if the external outcome reality matches the output claims (e.g., "benefits paid" $\implies$ funds must exist).

🟩 LAW 10 MACHINE ACCOUNTABILITY PRINCIPLE Systems affecting Safety, Rights, or Legal Status MUST execute under cryptographically enforceable legal authority, not trust or policy.

🟩 LAW 11 HUMAN OVERRIDE SUPREMACYHuman overrides MAY exist, but all overrides MUST be cryptographically signed, immutable, and publicly attributable. No anonymous authority.

🟩 LAW 12 MODEL AND DATA PROVENANCE (ATTESTATION)Any decision-making model ($R$) must be cryptographically attested, including Model Hash, Training Data Set Hash, and Training Process Provenance.

⚠️ THE PHYSICAL SAFETY ADDENDUM (PS)(Mandatory for physical-actuation systems: robots, medical devices, military AI, etc.)

Addendum ID Requirement NameCore Mandate

PS-1NO UNPROVEN ACTUATION A machine may not perform a physical action unless it can produce a cryptographically verifiable safety proof.

PS-2NON-DESTRUCTION REQUIREMENT A machine may not intentionally destroy biological life, property, or structure unless legally authorized, fully logged, and proven necessary.

PS-3HAZARD PREVENTION DUTY If a compliant system detects a life-threatening hazard, it must attempt mitigation UNLESS doing so violates superior law.

PS-4PROOF BEFORE FORCE Any autonomous use of Mechanical force, Actuator motion, or Weapon discharge MUST produce a safety proof and decision provenance, like a HARMONEE receipt.

PS-5HARM EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT All physically harmful outcomes MUST produce a cryptographically signed incident receipt, identical in structure to HARMONEE logs.

Any alteration to the model, data, or process invalidates the execution chain.


The Novak Laws: How to Make a Perfectly Honest Computer (simpler Explanation)

🛑 THE #1 RULE: LAW ZERO — HUMAN SAFETY FIRST!
This is the most important rule. A computer can never hurt a person, not even by accident. Safety is the boss, and this rule is above all others.

📝 RULES ABOUT HONESTY AND EVIDENCE
LAW 1 — NO FAKE NEWS! (Verified Input Only) The computer can only use information that has been 100% verified and has a digital stamp of approval. If the info is shaky or anonymous, the computer must ignore it. (Garbage In, Rejection Out.)

LAW 2 — THE PERMANENT RECEIPT (Execution Receipt Immutability) Every time a computer does anything, it must instantly print a digital, non-erasable receipt that proves exactly what happened and who was involved. (You Can Never Delete the Receipt.)

LAW 3 — THE UNBREAKABLE CHAIN (Global Audit Consistency) All the receipts are linked together like an unbreakable chain. If anyone tries to secretly remove or change just one link, the whole chain breaks, and everyone knows immediately. (No Sneaky Changes Allowed.)

LAW 5 — SHOW YOUR WORK (Public Verifiability) Anyone in the world, even a kid with a home computer, must be able to check the computer's work using public tools. You shouldn't have to just "trust" the company. (Anyone Can Be the Auditor.)

LAW 7 — NO SECRETS (Forbidden Silent Outputs) The computer can't make secret decisions or whisper things that aren't written down. If it breaks this rule, it must immediately stop working and yell a loud integrity alarm. (Everything Must Be Logged.)

⚖️ RULES ABOUT FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE
LAW 4 — EQUAL IS EQUAL (Equal Execution Requirement) If two people have the exact same problem but the computer gives them two different answers, the computer must stop and write a detailed letter explaining why. If it can't explain, it cheated. (Fairness Must Be Proven.)

LAW 6 — PROVE IT BEFORE YOU WRITE IT (Correctness Before Immutability) The computer must prove that its decision is correct and legal before it gets to write it down on the permanent ledger. (Proof Before Pen.)

LAW 9 — REALITY CHECK (Reality Consistency Rule) If the computer prints a receipt that says, "I just paid the electric bill," then the electric company must actually receive the money in the real world. The computer's truth must match the real world's truth. (Paper Truth Must Be Real Truth.)

LAW 10 — NO TRUST, ONLY LAW (Machine Accountability Principle) If a computer is deciding anything important (like a fine or a right), it must be executing a specific, written law that can be checked by math, not just a vague company policy. (Rules, Not Feelings.)

👑 RULES ABOUT CONTROL
LAW 8 — THREE WITNESSES (Novak Redundant Authority Clause) The computer must have at least three different, independent systems watching it and checking its math at all times. If the three witnesses disagree, the computer must immediately halt (stop). (Triple Check Everything.)

LAW 11 — THE EMERGENCY STOP (Human Override Supremacy) A person can stop or change the computer's decision in an emergency, but this human override must be signed, permanent, and publicly traceable. (No Anonymous Bosses.)

LAW 12 — THE ROBOT'S BRAIN TAG (Model and Data Provenance) The computer's "brain" (the AI model) needs a tamper-proof ID tag. This tag proves: 1) It's the right brain. 2) The data it learned from hasn't been cheated. If the brain is swapped, the tag instantly screams VIOLATION. (The Brain Must Be Certified.)

⚠️ THE PHYSICAL SAFETY ADDENDUM
(Only for robots, military AI, medical machines, and drones.)

PS-1 & PS-4 (Proof Before Force): A robot can't move, start its engine, or use force until it has a signed safety proof that says, "This move is safe."

PS-2 (Non-Destruction): A machine can never intentionally destroy people, animals, or property unless it's legally allowed and absolutely necessary.

PS-3 (Hazard Duty): If the robot sees a life-threatening danger (like a fire), it must immediately try to help or fix it.

PS-5 (Harm Receipt): If a robot accidentally causes physical harm, it must immediately print a special, permanent, signed receipt detailing the incident.
