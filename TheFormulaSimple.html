The Formula: "Math, Crypto, or What?"
It is Pure Mathematics used for Cryptography.

The specific formula used here is SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit). It is not "magic"; it is a series of logical math operations.

Imagine the formula is a mechanical meat grinder.

Input: You put in a whole cow (your data).

The Formula (The Grinder):

Padding: It adds bits to the data so it's a standard length.

Slicing: It cuts the data into tiny 32-bit blocks.

Mixing (The Math): It runs these blocks through 64 rounds of specific math operations:

XOR: (If bits are different, output 1; if same, output 0).

Right Rotate: (Shift all bits to the right, wrapping the end bits back to the start).

Addition: (Standard adding of numbers).

Output: You get ground beef.

Why is this special? Because it is One-Way Math. You can easily turn the cow into ground beef, but no amount of math in the universe can turn the ground beef back into a cow. This is why it creates "Verification." If I show you the ground beef (the Hash), I can prove I had the cow (the Data), but I don't have to show you the cow if I don't want to.
