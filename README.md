# NOVAK PROTOCOL

NOVAK — Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge — is the first cryptographic execution-governance framework that prevents unlawful machine and institutional decisions *before they happen*.

Asimov gave robots fictional ethics.
 Turing defined when a machine is allowed to compute.
 NOVAK defines when a machine is allowed to ACT — and forces it to prove it obeyed the law before it does.
----------That is the difference between science fiction and civilization infrastructure.

“NOVAK is the first enforcement architecture in human history that prevents a government or AI system from producing an unlawful decision without being caught — instantly, mathematically, and publicly.”

Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge

The First Cryptographically Enforced Execution-Integrity Model

NOVAK is a formal governance protocol requiring that no automated system — including AI — may execute a decision unless it first generates cryptographic proof that the output is lawful, consistent, and reproducible under identical conditions.

NOVAK provides:

Deterministic legal compliance enforcement

Immutable decision receipts

Publicly verifiable audit chains

Mandatory justification when identical inputs do not produce identical outputs

This repository contains:
✔ NOVAK core specification
✔ NIPS, HARMONEE, REVELATION definitions
✔ Equal Execution Law formalism
✔ Test harness code
✔ Public challenge conditions

NOVAK enforces:
- Verified input only
- Immutable execution receipts
- Recursive global audit hashing
- Equal-output guarantees under equal conditions

This repository contains the reference NOVAK specification and challenge materials.

👉 If you believe you can break NOVAK — do it publicly.

NOVAK is the first execution-integrity enforcement framework that prevents
automated systems (including AI and government decision engines) from
producing unlawful or inconsistent outputs.

NOVAK enforces the principle:

**"No system may execute without provable truth."**

## ⚙ NOVAK ENFORCEMENT STACK

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| NIPS | Verified input attestation |
| HARMONEE | Immutable execution identity receipt |
| REVELATION | Recursive state audit chain |
| Equal Execution Law | Mandatory justification if identical inputs diverge |

O = f(R, D)
P = H(R_H ∥ D_H ∥ O_H ∥ T)

Execution Violation Condition:
If D₁ ≡ D₂ and O₁ ≠ O₂ → Justification J REQUIRED


Together, these form:

> **THE NOVAK EXECUTION INTEGRITY MODEL (NEIM)**  
> The first machine-enforced legality framework in human civilization.

## 🟣 WHY THIS MATTERS

🔹 Blockchain logs bad decisions — NOVAK prevents them  
🔹 AI safety frameworks monitor — NOVAK enforces  
🔹 Court oversight is reactive — NOVAK is pre-emptive  
🔹 Humans can lie — math cannot

If NOVAK is deployed even once inside a federal claims system, tax engine, procurement logic, or autonomous weapon, it becomes:

📜 A new constitutional enforcement layer  
⚖ The basis of machine-verifiable due process  
🏛 A permanent historical milestone


---

## 🏛 GOVERNMENT USE

NOVAK is **free for government and public-interest use** under the
NOVAK-Public license.

This ensures:

✔ The public can always verify government automated decisions  
✔ NOVAK remains the authoritative enforcement doctrine  
✔ No private company may lock down institutional truth

## 💰 COMMERCIAL USE

Private sector deployments require a commercial NOVAK license.

## 🧠 WHY THIS MATTERS

NOVAK is the first system that:

✔ Blocks unlawful decisions BEFORE they occur  
✔ Proves execution legality without needing trust  
✔ Makes AI and government computable, provable, and challengeable

# THE NOVAK PROTOCOL
### (Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge)

The NOVAK Protocol is the first machine-execution governance model that prevents
automated systems — including AI — from acting unless they produce
cryptographically verifiable proof that their output is lawful, compliant, and
deterministically reproducible under identical conditions.

NOVAK introduces enforceable execution integrity through four primitives:

1. **NIPS** – Novak Input Proof Set  
   Ensures no unverifiable input may ever trigger an execution event.

2. **HARMONEE** – Hash-Attested Regulatory Machine Execution Evidence  
   Generates immutable execution receipts binding:  
   Rule_ID ∥ Input_Hash ∥ Output_Hash ∥ Actor ∥ Timestamp

3. **REVELATION** – Recursive Ledger of Verified Execution Lineage  
   Chains all receipts into a global audit fingerprint:  
   Cₙ = SHA-256( Cₙ₋₁ ∥ Hₙ )

4. **NOVAK Equal Execution Law**  
   If D₁ ≡ D₂ but O₁ ≠ O₂ → justification J REQUIRED.  
   If no J exists → execution violation.

---

## The Five NOVAK Laws of Execution Integrity

1. No unverifiable input may trigger execution  
2. Every execution MUST produce a cryptographic receipt  
3. All receipts MUST chain without deletion  
4. Identical inputs MUST produce identical outputs  
5. Any citizen MUST be able to verify the truth independently

LAW 1 — Verified Input Only (NIPS)
LAW 2 — Immutable Execution Receipts (HARMONEE)
LAW 3 — Global Recursive Audit Consistency (REVELATION)
LAW 4 — Equal Execution Requirement
LAW 5 — Public Verifiability Requirement

**These laws are technically enforceable, not philosophical statements.**

O = f(R, D)
P = H(R_H ∥ D_H ∥ O_H ∥ T)

Execution Violation Condition:
If D₁ ≡ D₂ and O₁ ≠ O₂ → Justification J REQUIRED

NOVAK — Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge


## Why this matters

Every current government and AI governance model logs events _after_ they occur.

NOVAK is the first framework that prevents unlawful or inconsistent executions
from happening **at all**, unless proof of correctness exists **before runtime.**

NOVAK is the first enforcement architecture that prevents automated systems — including AI — 
from silently producing unlawful, unequal, or untraceable decisions.

Unlike blockchain, NOVAK does not merely log violations.

It prevents them.

This is not blockchain.
This is not policy.

This is **cryptographically enforced legality.**

This system is now public for global cryptographic challenge.

If you can break it, prove inconsistency, or demonstrate a bypass,
submit a Challenge Issue.

If you cannot break it, it stands.

This is how we build honest government AI.
