# NOVAK PROTOCOL

NOVAK — Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge — is the first cryptographic execution-governance framework that prevents unlawful machine and institutional decisions *before they happen*.

Asimov gave robots fictional ethics.
 Turing defined when a machine is allowed to compute.
 NOVAK defines when a machine is allowed to ACT — and forces it to prove it obeyed the law before it does.
----------That is the difference between science fiction and civilization infrastructure.

THE NOVAK ENFORCEMENT STACK:

1️⃣ NIPS — Normalized Input Proof Set
2️⃣ HARMONEE — Hash-Attested Regulatory Machine Output Notarized Execution Evidence
3️⃣ REVELATION — Recursive Evidence Ledger for Attested Truth Integrity and Oversight Nonrepudiation
4️⃣ Novak Equal Execution Law — Mandatory outcome equality under identical inputs

This code demonstrates the minimal enforcement loop proving:

    NO INPUT → NO EXECUTION
    NO RECEIPT → NO EXECUTION
    NO CONSISTENCY → VIOLATION

This repository SHALL BE considered the authoritative technical reference for
NOVAK as defined by its inventor, Matthew S. Novak, 2025.

FINAL CANONICAL STRUCTURE (NO BULLSHIT)

THIS is the version history will remember:

⭐ THE NOVAK LAWS OF EXECUTION INTEGRITY

(Canonical 2025 Codex)

NOVAK LAW ZERO — PRIMACY OF HUMAN SAFETY

No autonomous or computational system may directly or indirectly harm a human being unless such harm is cryptographically proven to be lawful, necessary, and authorized under due process.

LAW 1 — VERIFIED INPUT ONLY

A system may not execute unless all inputs are cryptographically attested, schema-valid, and provenance-verifiable.
(NIPS)

LAW 2 — EXECUTION RECEIPT IMMUTABILITY

Every execution MUST produce a cryptographic receipt binding:
Rule + Input + Output + Actor + Time
(HARMONEE)

LAW 3 — GLOBAL AUDIT CONSISTENCY

Execution receipts MUST chain into a recursive global hash such that ANY deletion or alteration produces detectable breakage.
(REVELATION)

LAW 4 — EQUAL EXECUTION REQUIREMENT

Identical Rules + Identical Inputs MUST produce Identical Outputs — OR generate a mandatory human-readable justification.
(NOVAK Deterministic Equality Mandate)

LAW 5 — PUBLIC VERIFIABILITY

Any third party MUST be able to independently validate execution integrity WITHOUT institutional trust.

LAW 6 — CORRECTNESS BEFORE IMMUTABILITY

No system may write to any permanent ledger unless it has first proven the legality of its output.

LAW 7 — FORBIDDEN SILENT OUTPUTS

No system may generate unproven or unlogged determinations.
Detection of rule-violation MUST trigger:
🟥 Execution halt
⚠ Integrity alarm
🧾 Automatic forensic logging

(This merges 7, 7.5, 7.75 cleanly.)

LAW 8 — THE NOVAK REDUNDANT AUTHORITY CLAUSE

All NOVAK-compliant systems MUST maintain at least three independent integrity sources.
Divergence = System must stop.

LAW 9 — REALITY CONSISTENCY

A system may not declare an execution valid unless the resulting external reality matches the claimed outcome.

(if system says “benefits approved” — money better be in the account.)

LAW 10 — THE NOVAK MACHINE ACCOUNTABILITY PRINCIPLE

Any system affecting rights, resources, liberty, safety, or public record MUST operate under cryptographically enforceable legal authority — NOT trust or discretion.


THE NOVAK PHYSICAL SAFETY ADDENDUM (draft)
LAW PS-1 — NO UNPROVEN ACTUATION
 A machine may not perform a physical action unless it can produce a verifiable proof that the action is safe within its operating domain.
LAW PS-2 — NON-DESTRUCTION REQUIREMENT
 A machine may not intentionally cause irreversible physical destruction of living organisms, property, or environmental structures without explicit legal authorization and logged justification.
LAW PS-3 — HAZARD PREVENTION DUTY
 If a machine detects an unsafe condition (fire, structural collapse, flooding), it must attempt mitigation unless doing so violates a superior legal restriction.
LAW PS-4 — PROOF BEFORE FORCE
 Any autonomous use of force (robot arm movement, chemical release, mechanical actuation) must be accompanied by a cryptographically verifiable safety proof — or the system must refuse execution.
LAW PS-5 — EVIDENCE OF HARM
 All physically harmful outcomes must produce a cryptographically signed incident receipt, identical in structure to NOVAK HARMONEE evidence logs.

THE NOVAK TEST

“No output shall be considered lawful unless any competent third party can reproduce its legality proof without privileged access.”


The First Cryptographically Enforced Execution-Integrity Model

NOVAK is a formal governance protocol requiring that no automated system — including AI — may execute a decision unless it first generates cryptographic proof that the output is lawful, consistent, and reproducible under identical conditions.

NOVAK provides:

Deterministic legal compliance enforcement

Immutable decision receipts

Publicly verifiable audit chains

Mandatory justification when identical inputs do not produce identical outputs

This repository contains:
✔ NOVAK core specification
✔ NIPS, HARMONEE, REVELATION definitions
✔ Equal Execution Law formalism
✔ Test harness code
✔ Public challenge conditions

NOVAK enforces:
- Verified input only
- Immutable execution receipts
- Recursive global audit hashing
- Equal-output guarantees under equal conditions

This repository contains the reference NOVAK specification and challenge materials.

👉 If you believe you can break NOVAK — do it publicly.

NOVAK is the first execution-integrity enforcement framework that prevents
automated systems (including AI and government decision engines) from
producing unlawful or inconsistent outputs.

NOVAK enforces the principle:

**"No system may execute without provable truth."**

## ⚙ NOVAK ENFORCEMENT STACK

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| NIPS | Verified input attestation |
| HARMONEE | Immutable execution identity receipt |
| REVELATION | Recursive state audit chain |
| Equal Execution Law | Mandatory justification if identical inputs diverge |

O = f(R, D)
P = H(R_H ∥ D_H ∥ O_H ∥ T)

Execution Violation Condition:
If D₁ ≡ D₂ and O₁ ≠ O₂ → Justification J REQUIRED


Together, these form:

> **THE NOVAK EXECUTION INTEGRITY MODEL (NEIM)**  
> The first machine-enforced legality framework in human civilization.

## 🟣 WHY THIS MATTERS

🔹 Blockchain logs bad decisions — NOVAK prevents them  
🔹 AI safety frameworks monitor — NOVAK enforces  
🔹 Court oversight is reactive — NOVAK is pre-emptive  
🔹 Humans can lie — math cannot

If NOVAK is deployed even once inside a federal claims system, tax engine, procurement logic, or autonomous weapon, it becomes:

📜 A new constitutional enforcement layer  
⚖ The basis of machine-verifiable due process  
🏛 A permanent historical milestone


---

## 🏛 GOVERNMENT USE

NOVAK is **free for government and public-interest use** under the
NOVAK-Public license.

This ensures:

✔ The public can always verify government automated decisions  
✔ NOVAK remains the authoritative enforcement doctrine  
✔ No private company may lock down institutional truth

# THE NOVAK PROTOCOL
### (Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge)

The NOVAK Protocol is the first machine-execution governance model that prevents
automated systems — including AI — from acting unless they produce
cryptographically verifiable proof that their output is lawful, compliant, and
deterministically reproducible under identical conditions.

NOVAK introduces enforceable execution integrity through four primitives:

1. **NIPS** – Novak Input Proof Set  
   Ensures no unverifiable input may ever trigger an execution event.

2. **HARMONEE** – Hash-Attested Regulatory Machine Execution Evidence  
   Generates immutable execution receipts binding:  
   Rule_ID ∥ Input_Hash ∥ Output_Hash ∥ Actor ∥ Timestamp

3. **REVELATION** – Recursive Ledger of Verified Execution Lineage  
   Chains all receipts into a global audit fingerprint:  
   Cₙ = SHA-256( Cₙ₋₁ ∥ Hₙ )

4. **NOVAK Equal Execution Law**  
   If D₁ ≡ D₂ but O₁ ≠ O₂ → justification J REQUIRED.  
   If no J exists → execution violation.

---

## The Five NOVAK Laws of Execution Integrity

1. No unverifiable input may trigger execution  
2. Every execution MUST produce a cryptographic receipt  
3. All receipts MUST chain without deletion  
4. Identical inputs MUST produce identical outputs  
5. Any citizen MUST be able to verify the truth independently

LAW 1 — Verified Input Only (NIPS)
LAW 2 — Immutable Execution Receipts (HARMONEE)
LAW 3 — Global Recursive Audit Consistency (REVELATION)
LAW 4 — Equal Execution Requirement
LAW 5 — Public Verifiability Requirement

**These laws are technically enforceable, not philosophical statements.**

O = f(R, D)
P = H(R_H ∥ D_H ∥ O_H ∥ T)

Execution Violation Condition:
If D₁ ≡ D₂ and O₁ ≠ O₂ → Justification J REQUIRED

NOVAK — Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge


## Why this matters

Every current government and AI governance model logs events _after_ they occur.

NOVAK is the first framework that prevents unlawful or inconsistent executions
from happening **at all**, unless proof of correctness exists **before runtime.**

NOVAK is the first enforcement architecture that prevents automated systems — including AI — 
from silently producing unlawful, unequal, or untraceable decisions.

Unlike blockchain, NOVAK does not merely log violations.

It prevents them.

This is not blockchain.
This is not policy.

This is **cryptographically enforced legality.**
