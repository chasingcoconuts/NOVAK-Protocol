# NOVAK PROTOCOL

NOVAK — Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge — is the first cryptographic execution-governance framework that prevents unlawful machine and institutional decisions *before they happen*.

NOVAK enforces:
- Verified input only
- Immutable execution receipts
- Recursive global audit hashing
- Equal-output guarantees under equal conditions

This repository contains the reference NOVAK specification and challenge materials.

👉 If you believe you can break NOVAK — do it publicly.

NOVAK is the first execution-integrity enforcement framework that prevents
automated systems (including AI and government decision engines) from
producing unlawful or inconsistent outputs.

NOVAK enforces the principle:

**"No system may execute without provable truth."**

## ⚙ NOVAK ENFORCEMENT STACK

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| NIPS | Verified input attestation |
| HARMONEE | Immutable execution identity receipt |
| REVELATION | Recursive state audit chain |
| Equal Execution Law | Mandatory justification if identical inputs diverge |

---

## 🏛 GOVERNMENT USE

NOVAK is **free for government and public-interest use** under the
NOVAK-Public license.

This ensures:

✔ The public can always verify government automated decisions  
✔ NOVAK remains the authoritative enforcement doctrine  
✔ No private company may lock down institutional truth

## 💰 COMMERCIAL USE

Private sector deployments require a commercial NOVAK license.

## 🧠 WHY THIS MATTERS

NOVAK is the first system that:

✔ Blocks unlawful decisions BEFORE they occur  
✔ Proves execution legality without needing trust  
✔ Makes AI and government computable, provable, and challengeable

# THE NOVAK PROTOCOL
### (Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge)

The NOVAK Protocol is the first machine-execution governance model that prevents
automated systems — including AI — from acting unless they produce
cryptographically verifiable proof that their output is lawful, compliant, and
deterministically reproducible under identical conditions.

NOVAK introduces enforceable execution integrity through four primitives:

1. **NIPS** – Normalized Input Proof Set  
   Ensures no unverifiable input may ever trigger an execution event.

2. **HARMONEE** – Hash-Attested Regulatory Machine Execution Evidence  
   Generates immutable execution receipts binding:  
   Rule_ID ∥ Input_Hash ∥ Output_Hash ∥ Actor ∥ Timestamp

3. **REVELATION** – Recursive Ledger of Verified Execution Lineage  
   Chains all receipts into a global audit fingerprint:  
   Cₙ = SHA-256( Cₙ₋₁ ∥ Hₙ )

4. **NOVAK Equal Execution Law**  
   If D₁ ≡ D₂ but O₁ ≠ O₂ → justification J REQUIRED.  
   If no J exists → execution violation.

---

## The Five NOVAK Laws of Execution Integrity

1. No unverifiable input may trigger execution  
2. Every execution MUST produce a cryptographic receipt  
3. All receipts MUST chain without deletion  
4. Identical inputs MUST produce identical outputs  
5. Any citizen MUST be able to verify the truth independently

**These laws are technically enforceable, not philosophical statements.**

---

## Why this matters

Every current government and AI governance model logs events _after_ they occur.

NOVAK is the first framework that prevents unlawful or inconsistent executions
from happening **at all**, unless proof of correctness exists **before runtime.**

This is not blockchain.
This is not policy.

This is **cryptographically enforced legality.**
