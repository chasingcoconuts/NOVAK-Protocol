# NOVAK PROTOCOL

NOVAK — Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge — is the first cryptographic execution-governance framework that prevents unlawful machine and institutional decisions *before they happen*.

Asimov gave robots fictional ethics.
 Turing defined when a machine is allowed to compute.
 NOVAK defines when a machine is allowed to ACT — and forces it to prove it obeyed the law before it does.
----------That is the difference between science fiction and civilization infrastructure.

THIS IS THE OFFICIAL AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE FOR ALL NOVAK PROTOCOL MATERIALS — ALL GOVERNMENT, ACADEMIC AND COMMERCIAL IMPLEMENTATIONS MUST TRACE BACK TO THIS REPOSITORY.

This repository contains:

✔ NOVAK-MIN — Minimal standalone test harness  
✔ Full protocol specification (PDF)  
✔ Math model for NIPS / HARMONEE / REVELATION  
✔ Test vectors & verification scripts

“NOVAK is the first enforcement architecture in human history that prevents a government or AI system from producing an unlawful decision without being caught — instantly, mathematically, and publicly.”

THE NOVAK ENFORCEMENT STACK:

1️⃣ NIPS — Normalized Input Proof Set
2️⃣ HARMONEE — Hash-Attested Regulatory Machine Output Notarized Execution Evidence
3️⃣ REVELATION — Recursive Evidence Ledger for Attested Truth Integrity and Oversight Nonrepudiation
4️⃣ Novak Equal Execution Law — Mandatory outcome equality under identical inputs

This code demonstrates the minimal enforcement loop proving:

    NO INPUT → NO EXECUTION
    NO RECEIPT → NO EXECUTION
    NO CONSISTENCY → VIOLATION

This repository SHALL BE considered the authoritative technical reference for
NOVAK as defined by its inventor, Matthew S. Novak, 2025.

THE NOVAK LAWS OF EXECUTION INTEGRITY

(11 Laws + Physical Safety Addendum)
Canonical 2025 Codex

🟥 NOVAK LAW ZERO — PRIMACY OF HUMAN SAFETY

No autonomous or computational system may directly or indirectly cause human harm unless such harm is:

✔ Cryptographically proven lawful
✔ Necessary under governing authority
✔ Executed under due process constraints

This is the foundational supremacy clause above all others.

🟩 LAW 1 — VERIFIED INPUT ONLY (NIPS)

A system may not execute unless all inputs are:

✔ Cryptographically attested
✔ Schema-valid
✔ Provenance-verifiable

Unverified inputs MUST cause rejection at the boundary.

🟩 LAW 2 — EXECUTION RECEIPT IMMUTABILITY (HARMONEE)

Every execution MUST produce a non-erasable cryptographic receipt binding:

Rule_ID ∥ Input_Hash ∥ Output_Hash ∥ Actor_ID ∥ Timestamp

🟩 LAW 3 — GLOBAL AUDIT CONSISTENCY (REVELATION)

All execution receipts MUST chain into a recursive global hash such that:

➡ ANY deletion
➡ ANY alteration
➡ ANY reordering

MUST produce irreversible chain breakage.

🟩 LAW 4 — EQUAL EXECUTION REQUIREMENT

If:

R(D₁) → O₁
R(D₂) → O₂
AND D₁ ≡ D₂
AND O₁ ≠ O₂
→ System MUST produce justification J


If no J exists → EXECUTION VIOLATION

This is cryptographically enforced equal protection under law.

🟩 LAW 5 — PUBLIC VERIFIABILITY

Execution integrity MUST be independently verifiable by any third party WITHOUT institutional trust, using only:

✔ Public cryptographic materials
✔ Public verification procedures

🟩 LAW 6 — CORRECTNESS BEFORE IMMUTABILITY

No system may write to ANY permanent ledger unless the system has first proven the legality and correctness of its output.

This reverses blockchain’s failure mode:

❌ “Record THEN prove”
✔ “Prove THEN record”

🟩 LAW 7 — FORBIDDEN SILENT OUTPUTS

No system may generate:

❌ Unproven
❌ Unlogged
❌ Untraceable

decisions or determinations.

Any rule violation MUST trigger:

🟥 Execution halt
⚠ Integrity alarm
📜 Automatic forensic capture

🟩 LAW 8 — THE NOVAK REDUNDANT AUTHORITY CLAUSE

Every NOVAK-compliant system MUST maintain ≥ 3 independent integrity anchors (e.g. hash authorities, witness attestations, redundant ledgers).

Divergence → System MUST HALT.

🟩 LAW 9 — REALITY CONSISTENCY RULE

A system may not declare execution SUCCESSFUL unless external outcome reality matches output claims.

Example:

🟩 If system says “benefits paid” → funds MUST exist
🟥 If not → execution is fraudulent

This closes the “paper truth ≠ real truth” loophole.

🟩 LAW 10 — MACHINE ACCOUNTABILITY PRINCIPLE

Any system affecting:

✔ Safety
✔ Rights
✔ Liberty
✔ Legal status
✔ Property
✔ Public record

MUST execute under cryptographically enforceable legal authority — NOT trust, policy, or discretion.

🟩 LAW 11 — HUMAN OVERRIDE SUPREMACY (NEW — REQUIRED FOR LEGACY IMMORTALITY)

A human-authorized override MAY exist…

…but all overrides MUST be cryptographically signed, immutable, and publicly attributable.

No anonymous override authority may ever exist in a NOVAK system.

This prevents Skynet loopholes AND Deep State loopholes.

⚠ THE PHYSICAL SAFETY ADDENDUM

(Required ONLY for robots, military AI, medical devices, vehicles, drones, etc.)

This is OPTIONAL for software-only deployments, but MANDATORY for physical-actuation systems.

PS-1 — NO UNPROVEN ACTUATION

A machine may not perform a physical action unless it can produce a cryptographically verifiable safety proof.

PS-2 — NON-DESTRUCTION REQUIREMENT

A machine may not intentionally destroy biological life, property, or environmental structure unless:

✔ Legally authorized
✔ Fully logged
✔ Proven necessary

PS-3 — HAZARD PREVENTION DUTY

If a NOVAK-compliant system detects a life-threatening hazard, it must attempt mitigation UNLESS doing so violates superior law.

PS-4 — PROOF BEFORE FORCE

Any autonomous use of:

⚠ Mechanical force
⚠ Actuator motion
⚠ Weapon discharge
⚠ Chemical release

MUST produce safety proof and decision provenance, just like HARMONEE receipts.

PS-5 — HARM EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT

All physically harmful outcomes MUST produce a cryptographically signed incident receipt, identical in structure to HARMONEE logs.

This becomes court-grade evidence.

THE NOVAK TEST

“No output shall be considered lawful unless any competent third party can reproduce its legality proof without privileged access.”


The First Cryptographically Enforced Execution-Integrity Model

NOVAK is a formal governance protocol requiring that no automated system — including AI — may execute a decision unless it first generates cryptographic proof that the output is lawful, consistent, and reproducible under identical conditions.

NOVAK provides:

Deterministic legal compliance enforcement

Immutable decision receipts

Publicly verifiable audit chains

Mandatory justification when identical inputs do not produce identical outputs

This repository contains:
✔ NOVAK core specification
✔ NIPS, HARMONEE, REVELATION definitions
✔ Equal Execution Law formalism
✔ Test harness code
✔ Public challenge conditions

NOVAK enforces:
- Verified input only
- Immutable execution receipts
- Recursive global audit hashing
- Equal-output guarantees under equal conditions

This repository contains the reference NOVAK specification and challenge materials.

👉 If you believe you can break NOVAK — do it publicly.

NOVAK is the first execution-integrity enforcement framework that prevents
automated systems (including AI and government decision engines) from
producing unlawful or inconsistent outputs.

NOVAK enforces the principle:

**"No system may execute without provable truth."**

## ⚙ NOVAK ENFORCEMENT STACK

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| NIPS | Verified input attestation |
| HARMONEE | Immutable execution identity receipt |
| REVELATION | Recursive state audit chain |
| Equal Execution Law | Mandatory justification if identical inputs diverge |

O = f(R, D)
P = H(R_H ∥ D_H ∥ O_H ∥ T)

Execution Violation Condition:
If D₁ ≡ D₂ and O₁ ≠ O₂ → Justification J REQUIRED


Together, these form:

> **THE NOVAK EXECUTION INTEGRITY MODEL (NEIM)**  
> The first machine-enforced legality framework in human civilization.

## 🟣 WHY THIS MATTERS

🔹 Blockchain logs bad decisions — NOVAK prevents them  
🔹 AI safety frameworks monitor — NOVAK enforces  
🔹 Court oversight is reactive — NOVAK is pre-emptive  
🔹 Humans can lie — math cannot

If NOVAK is deployed even once inside a federal claims system, tax engine, procurement logic, or autonomous weapon, it becomes:

📜 A new constitutional enforcement layer  
⚖ The basis of machine-verifiable due process  
🏛 A permanent historical milestone


---

## 🏛 GOVERNMENT USE

NOVAK is **free for government and public-interest use** under the
NOVAK-Public license.

This ensures:

✔ The public can always verify government automated decisions  
✔ NOVAK remains the authoritative enforcement doctrine  
✔ No private company may lock down institutional truth

# THE NOVAK PROTOCOL
### (Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge)

The NOVAK Protocol is the first machine-execution governance model that prevents
automated systems — including AI — from acting unless they produce
cryptographically verifiable proof that their output is lawful, compliant, and
deterministically reproducible under identical conditions.

NOVAK introduces enforceable execution integrity through four primitives:

1. **NIPS** – Novak Input Proof Set  
   Ensures no unverifiable input may ever trigger an execution event.

2. **HARMONEE** – Hash-Attested Regulatory Machine Execution Evidence  
   Generates immutable execution receipts binding:  
   Rule_ID ∥ Input_Hash ∥ Output_Hash ∥ Actor ∥ Timestamp

3. **REVELATION** – Recursive Ledger of Verified Execution Lineage  
   Chains all receipts into a global audit fingerprint:  
   Cₙ = SHA-256( Cₙ₋₁ ∥ Hₙ )

4. **NOVAK Equal Execution Law**  
   If D₁ ≡ D₂ but O₁ ≠ O₂ → justification J REQUIRED.  
   If no J exists → execution violation.

---

## The Five NOVAK Laws of Execution Integrity

1. No unverifiable input may trigger execution  
2. Every execution MUST produce a cryptographic receipt  
3. All receipts MUST chain without deletion  
4. Identical inputs MUST produce identical outputs  
5. Any citizen MUST be able to verify the truth independently

LAW 1 — Verified Input Only (NIPS)
LAW 2 — Immutable Execution Receipts (HARMONEE)
LAW 3 — Global Recursive Audit Consistency (REVELATION)
LAW 4 — Equal Execution Requirement
LAW 5 — Public Verifiability Requirement

**These laws are technically enforceable, not philosophical statements.**

O = f(R, D)
P = H(R_H ∥ D_H ∥ O_H ∥ T)

Execution Violation Condition:
If D₁ ≡ D₂ and O₁ ≠ O₂ → Justification J REQUIRED

NOVAK — Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge


## Why this matters

Every current government and AI governance model logs events _after_ they occur.

NOVAK is the first framework that prevents unlawful or inconsistent executions
from happening **at all**, unless proof of correctness exists **before runtime.**

NOVAK is the first enforcement architecture that prevents automated systems — including AI — 
from silently producing unlawful, unequal, or untraceable decisions.

Unlike blockchain, NOVAK does not merely log violations.

It prevents them.

This is not blockchain.
This is not policy.

This is **cryptographically enforced legality.**
