# NOVAK Protocol

# The NOVAK Protocol

This repository contains the first implementation of the NOVAK Kernel
(Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge), the world’s
first deterministic execution integrity model requiring cryptographic
proof of legal compliance prior to autonomous system execution.

This is NOT a product. This is an enforcement doctrine.

If you can break it, prove it.

If you can implement it, deploy it.

If you try to steal it, you must erase the math — not my name.


**NOVAK – Novak Objective Verification of Autonomous Knowledge**  
The first execution integrity model requiring cryptographic proof of legality *before* any automated decision is allowed to run.

---

## 🚩 Problem

Modern automation systems — including AI — can make decisions that:
❌ Cannot be proven to follow governing rules  
❌ May silently violate rights, policies, or laws  
❌ Produce different results for identical inputs

There is currently **no enforcement layer** requiring machine truth *before* execution.

---

## ✅ Solution

The NOVAK Protocol defines the first **deterministic legality enforcement architecture**, built on four primitives:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **NIPS** | Normalized Input Proof Set – All data must be attested, schema-valid, and provenance-verifiable. |
| **HARMONEE** | Execution Receipt – Immutable proof of rule, input, output, actor and timestamp. |
| **REVELATION** | Recursive Audit Chain – Any deletion or alteration produces a detectable chain break. |
| **Equal Execution Law** | Identical inputs + identical rules must produce identical outputs, or justification is required. |
